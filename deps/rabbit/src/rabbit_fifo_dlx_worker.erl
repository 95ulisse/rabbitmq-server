%% This module consumes from a single quroum queue's discards queue (containing dead-letttered messages)
%% and forwards the DLX messages at least once to every target queue.
%%
%% Some parts of this module resemble the channel process in the sense that it needs to keep track what messages
%% are consumed but not acked yet and what messages are published but not confirmed yet.
%% Compared to the channel process, this module is protocol independent since it doesn't deal with AMQP clients.
%%
%% This module consumes directly from the rabbit_fifo_dlx_client bypassing the rabbit_queue_type interface,
%% but publishes via the rabbit_queue_type interface.
%% While consuming via rabbit_queue_type interface would have worked in practice (by using a special consumer argument,
%% e.g. {<<"x-internal-queue">>, longstr, <<"discards">>} ) using the rabbit_fifo_dlx_client directly provides
%% separation of concerns making things much easier to test, to debug, and to understand.

%% Quorum queues maintain their own Raft sequene number mapping to the message sequence number (= Raft correlation ID).
%% So, they would just send us a 'settled' queue action containing the correct message sequence number.
%%
%% Classic queues however maintain their state by mapping the message sequence number to pending and confirmed queues.
%% While re-using the same message sequence number could work there as well, it just gets unnecssary complicated when
%% different target queues settle two separate deliveries referring to the same message sequence number (and same basic message).
%%
%% Therefore, to keep things simple, create a brand new delivery, store it in our state and forget about the old delivery and
%% sequence number.
%%
%% If a sequene number gets settled after settle_timeout, we can't map it anymore to the #pending{}. Hence, we ignore it.
%%
%% This can lead to issues when settle_timeout is too low and time to settle takes too long.
%% For example, if settle_timeout is set to only 10 seconds, but settling a message takes always longer than 10 seconds
%% (e.g. due to extremly slow hypervisor disks that ran out of credit), we will re-deliver the same message all over again
%% leading to many duplicates in the target queue without ever acking the message back to the source discards queue.
%%
%% Therefore, set settle_timeout reasonably high (e.g. 2 minutes).
